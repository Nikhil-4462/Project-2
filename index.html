                <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">One purpose of coding is to transform the data into a form suitable
                    for computer-aided analysis. This categorization of information is an important step, for example,
                    in preparing data for computer processing with statistical software. Prior to coding, an annotation
                    scheme is defined. It consists of codes or tags. During coding, coders manually add codes into data
                    where required features are identified. The coding scheme ensures that the codes are added
                    consistently across the data set and allows for verification of previously tagged data.[1].</p>

                <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out
                    sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern
                    computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs
                    enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer including the
                    hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for
                    "full" operation can be referred to as a computer system</p>

                <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the
                    acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include
                    teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place
                    under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take
                    place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one
                    thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. </p>
